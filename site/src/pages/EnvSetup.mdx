# Setting up CircuitPython

## Install dependencies
First, we're going to install all the tools we need before setting anything up.

### Git
[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is needed to work with the repository and get everything set up!

### Python
[Python 3](https://www.python.org/) is required. Feel free to install using your preferred method (i.e package manager, executable, etc). Make sure that the Python command works!

### Your IDE
[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is recommended, but you're free to use any IDE you prefer.

## Create your environment
After installing all the dependencies, now we can set up our actual environment! First, make the folder we'll be working in and go into it

```Bash
mkdir hackapet-env && cd hackapet-env
```
next, clone the repository into a folder named "repo"
```Bash
git clone https://github.com/hackclub/hackapet repo
```

that's it! now onto the Operating-System specific instructions

### MacOS & Linux
MacOS is pretty similar to windows, except we also need to set up a virutal environment. First, in your hackapet-env folder, create a virtual environment:
```Bash
python -m venv venv
```
then, activate the virtual environment:
```Bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

Continue with the Windows instructions from here!

### Windows
If you're on Windows the only thing to catch for is that you're using Windows Terminal and not powershell or command prompt.

### Running the example

head on over into the example folder (repo/pets/acons_example_pet) and install the necessary libraries:

```Bash
cd repo/pets/acons_example_pet && \
pip3 install requirements.txt
```
everything should be good to go! Run the following command and it should start:
```Bash
python code/main.py
```
If it doesn't work, try using Windows Terminal instead of powershell or Command Prompt. If it still doesn't work, ask in #hackapet!

### Create your own game
To create your own game, make a new folder in pets:
```Bash
cd .. && mkdir your_pet_name
```
And you're done! You can start coding your new game, head on over to the [guide](https://hackapet.hackclub.com/guide) to get started
