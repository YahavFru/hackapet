# Hackapet

A YSWS where you code + design a virtual pet, and we ship you a physical hackable tamagotchi clone to play it on!

Check out the site: https://hackapet.hackclub.com - includes more info + getting started guide!

## on submissions

When you've finished your game, create a PR in the /pets folder! 

Call your PR whatever your pet/game is named - also, **put your slack username in the PR comment so I can find you**!!

Note:
- you must be in high school (or younger!)
- all art must be drawn by you
- try to have at least 2 minutes of gameplay
- also: try to add on something more than what the example has

This YSWS ends Fed 3rd - get your pets in before then :D
